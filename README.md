  ## Overview 

  This project is a deep learning-based traffic sign classification system implemented using TensorFlow. 
  The model is trained on the GTSRB (German Traffic Sign Dataset), which consists of various traffic sign images. 
  The goal is to recognize and classify different types of traffic signs accurately.

  ### Dependencies
- Python 3
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- scikit-learn


## Dataset
The German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset is used for training and testing the model. It includes more than 50000 images which are seperated 39,209 for training and 12,630 for tesing. The images have varying light conditions, rich backgrounds and are seperated in 43 unique classes.
